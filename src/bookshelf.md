I primarily worked under a contract as a full-stack developer in enterprise rental management
software. Unsurprisingly, I sought resources that would help with the work I was conducting.
Overall, I gained an appreciation for:

- actively refactoring as part of a sprint cycle
- designing objects for change (this is a common motif in enterprise)
- handling legacy systems and major codebase changes
